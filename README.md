Many map images were created by taking screenshots on https://noclip.website

## Todo
1) Draw in the missing platforms on the Lake
2) Add support for `StartingLevitation: true` (will require support from Psychonauts AP)
3) Automatic map changing to match the current game level (will require support from Psychonauts AP and PsychoRando)
4) Find out if there's a way that locations can be manually marked by the user as baggage that cannot currently be collected
5) Mark baggage that is in logic, but cannot be collected, as visible (will require support from Psychonauts AP)
