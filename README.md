Many map images were created by taking screenshots on https://noclip.website

## Todo
1) Meat Circus Map
2) Asylum Map
3) Draw in the missing platforms on the Lake
4) `StartingLevitation: true` is not supported
5) Broadcast view
6) Automatic map changing to match the current game level (will require support from Psychonauts AP and PsychoRando)
7) Extra view for showing the specific camper brains that have been collected
8) Extra view(s) for non-important collectibles (baggage, baggage tags, vaults, PSI cards, PSI challenge markers, scavenger hunt items, watering can and crow feather)
9) Find out if there's a way that locations can be manually marked by the user as baggage that cannot currently be collected
